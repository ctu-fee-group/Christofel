If you are unsure how to find course you are looking for, contact others in <#1020326829623607356>.\n\nHello, here you can interactively choose what course channels you want to see here. What buttons do should be obvious from the labels, but below you can find the full instructions. This is currently a beta, if you find an error, report it to <#753695738671792211>.\n\nButtons **join/leave course by code** will open a modal with a text input. You can put **whole codes** of courses into the input separated by space. When you confirm the modal, the bot will assign you to/remove you from these courses. If you know only a part of a code or a name, try the button search courses.\n\nButtons **join/leave course by semester** will send you a message to select a semester (previous, current, next). After you choose a semester, the bot will add/remove the courses you are enrolled in for the given semester.\n\nButton **search courses** will open a modal with a text input. You can put parts of codes or parts of names (_some may work in english_) to search for.\n\nButton **search courses by semester** will send you a message to select a semester. After you select a semester, the bot will send you a message to choose what courses you want to add or remove.\n\nThe messages sent by the bot can be removed by clicking on _Dismiss message_ below the message. They won't be removed automatically.\nGood luck!"
